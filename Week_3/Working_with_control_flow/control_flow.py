### **Control Flow in Python**

# - Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program.
# Instead of always running line by line, control flow allows your program to:

#     - Make decisions (choose one path or another, explore alternatives).

#     - Repeat actions (loops).

#     - Exit or skip parts of code.

# - It is the foundation for logic and problem solving in programming.
# - Control flow is divided into 3 parts

#### **A. Conditional Statements**

# 1. `if` Statement

# - Executes a block only when a condition is true.

age = 20
if age >=18:
    print("You are eligible to vote")       # You are eligible to vote


# **Some usecases**

# - Checking for eligibility.

# - Validating login attempts.

# - Ensuring a minimum purchase requirement, etc.

# if-else Statement
# Provides two alternative paths.

wallet = 400
price = 500
if wallet >= price:
    print("Purchase successful")
else:
    print("Insufficient balance")      # Insufficient balance


# **Some usecases**

# - Deciding success or failure of a payment.

# - Granting or denying access to a system.

# - Determining pass/fail in an exam, etc.

# if-elif-else Statement
# Used for multiple conditions.

score = 85
if score >= 70:
    print("Grade A")
elif score >= 50:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Grade C")       # Grade A


# **Some usecases**
# - Student grading systems.

# - Assigning ticket categories (VIP, Regular, Student).

# - Categorizing temperatures (Hot, Warm, Cold), etc.

# 4. Nested if
# Placing an if inside another if

age = 19
citizen = True
if age >= 18:
    if citizen:
        print("You can vote")
    else:
        print("You must be a citizen to vote")
else:
    print("Too young to vote")            # You can a vote


# **Some usecases**

# - Voting eligibility (age + citizenship).

# - Banking (account active + balance sufficient).

# - School admission (age + grade level).

# B. Loops
# 1. for loop
# This is used for iterating over a sequence (strings, list, tuple, dictionary)


# Iterates through each element ina LIST

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}") 
# Output
# I like apple
# I like banana
# I like orange

## Some usecases
# Iterating through shopping lists.

# Checking availability of products.

# Displaying student names, etc.

# Iterates through each element in a TUPLE. This works like lists, but remember that tuples are immutable.
coordinates = (0.34654, -0.48585, 0.57477)
for point in coordinates:
    print(f"point: {point}")
# output
# point: 0.34654
# point: -0.48585
# point: 0.57477

## Some usecases
# Storing fixed sensor readings.
# Displaying fixed seating positions, etc.

# Iterates through each element in a DICTIONARY. Remember that dictionaries have key-value pairs.
# Items is used in dictionary for upacking i.e it prints each word or key and value
student = {"name": "Tunde", "age" : 16, "grade": "A"}
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
# Output
# name: Tunde
# age: 16
# grade: A

## Some usecases

# Reading database records.

# Showing user profile details.

# Checking configuration settings, etc.

# iterates through each element in a STRING. Remember that strings are sequences of characters.
word = "PYTHON"
for char in word:
    print(char)

# P
# Y
# T
# H
# O
# N

## Some usecases

# Counting vowels/consonants.

# Password validation (checking digits/special chars).

# Text analysis, etc.


# **2. `While` loop**

# - A while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code **as long as a given condition is true.**
# Unlike the for loop (which iterates over sequences like lists, tuples, etc.), the while loop is condition-based.

# ```
# while condition:
#     # code block
# ```

# - The condition must evaluate to `True` for the loop to continue running.

# - When the condition becomes `False`, the loop stops.

# Using while loop
## Documenting my thoughts##
## Let the loop start with count = 1
# Let it keep printing until count is greater than 5
# Let the loop terminate when the condition is no longer true

## My code
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Number:", count)
    count +=1
# Output
# Number: 1
# Number: 2
# Number: 3
# Number: 4
# Number: 5

num = 1
while num <=10:
    print(num, end=" ")
    num += 1             # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

# Decrementing with 'while'

timer = 10
while timer > 0:
    print("Countdown:", timer)
    timer -= 1

# Output 
# Countdown: 9
# Countdown: 8
# Countdown: 7
# Countdown: 6
# Countdown: 5
# Countdown: 4
# Countdown: 3
# Countdown: 2
# Countdown: 1

# While with User Input
## Keep asking until the user enters a correct password.
# since the password is empty, if i enter a different password, it will keep asking me for password until i enter the specified password give and it will print Access granted.

password = ""
while password != "python123":
    password = input("Enter the password: ")
print("Access Granted")

# **Understanding `while True`**

# - The while True: loop is an infinite loop — it keeps running forever until you explicitly stop it with a break statement or by exiting the program.

# - It is commonly used when:

# - You don’t know in advance how many times you want the loop to run.

# - You want to keep asking the user for input until a valid condition is met.

# - You are building continuous programs like menus, login systems, or simulations.


# ```
# while True:
#     # Code block
#     # Must include a break statement to stop

# ```


# Keep asking the user for a name until they type exit.

while True:
    name = input("Enter your name (type 'exit' to quit): ")
    if name.lower() =="exit":
        print("Goodbye!")
    break
print(f"Hello, {name}")

# ---> I used `break` here. If you dont know what it is or what it is doing, its OK. I will explain it next...

## Useful in chat-like applications, forms, or data entry programs where users may input multiple times until they decide to stop.


#### **Loop Control Statements (`break`, `continue` and `pass`)**

# - These keywords help us control the behavior of loops (for and while). Instead of loops always running all iterations, we can skip steps, stop early, or do nothing intentionally.

# **1. break**
# - Stops loop immediately. It is used if a condition is met and there’s no need to continue looping.

for num in range (1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
# output
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
#The loop stops completely when num == 5.

# Stop searching when an item is found.

# Exit when user input matches a condition.

# Prevent unnecessary iterations.

# **2. Continue**
# - Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one. It is used if you want to ignore some values but keep the loop running.

for num in range (1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
# Output
# 1
# 2
# 4
# 5

# 3 is skipped, but the loop continues.

## Some usecases

#Skip invalid data.

#Ignore unwanted characters (like spaces in a string).

#Continue running but avoid certain cases, etc.

# **3. Pass**
# - Does nothing. A placeholder to avoid errors. It is used If you haven’t written the code yet but want to keep the structure.

for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        pass        # do nothing for now
    print(num)

    # At num == 3, Python executes pass (nothing happens).

## Some usecases

# Writing code structure (to fill in later).

# Placeholders in class/method definitions.

# Temporarily disable parts of code.

# **Lets try while True again**

# Try and think through this...

while True:    
    print("\nMenu:")
    print("1. Say Hello")
    print("2. Say Goodbye")
    print("3. Exit")

    choice = input("Choose an option: ")

    if choice == "1":
        print("Hello")
    elif choice == "2":
        print("Goodbye")
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Exiting program...")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Try again")

# Output
# Menu:
# 1. Say Hello
# 2. Say Goodbye
# 3. Exit

while True:
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
    if age.isdigit():
        print(f"Your age is {age}")
        break
    else: 
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")


# Let's make a guess
secret = "python" 
while True:
    guess = input("Guess the secret word: ")
    if guess.lower() == secret:
        print("Correct! You guessed the word.")
        break
    else:
        print("Wrong! Try again.")


# Do you remember this?

balance = 1000

while True:
    print("\nATM Menu:")
    print("1. Check Balance")
    print("2. Withdraw")
    print("3. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter choice: ")
    if choice == "1":
        print(f"Your balance is: {balance}")
    elif choice == "2":
        amount = int(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
        if amount <= balance:
            balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawal successful. New balance: {balance}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
    elif choice == 3:
        print("Thank you for using our ATM. Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid option. Try again.")
